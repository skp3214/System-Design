# Singleton Design Pattern in Low-Level Design (LLD)

The **Singleton Design Pattern** is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, such as a configuration manager, database connection pool, or logging service. The pattern restricts instantiation of a class to a single object by making the constructor private and providing a static method to access the instance.

## Key Components
1. **Private Constructor**: Prevents direct instantiation of the class from outside.
2. **Static Instance**: Holds the single instance of the class.
3. **Static Access Method**: Provides global access to the instance, often implementing logic to ensure only one instance is created.

## Variants of Singleton
The provided code demonstrates different implementations of the Singleton pattern, each addressing specific needs such as thread safety and performance. Below, I’ll explain each variant with its code, advantages, and disadvantages.

### 1. Non-Singleton (Baseline for Comparison)
This is not a Singleton but a regular class that allows multiple instances, shown for contrast.

```java
public class NoSingleton {
    public NoSingleton() {
        System.out.println("Singleton Constructor called. New Object created.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NoSingleton s1 = new NoSingleton();
        NoSingleton s2 = new NoSingleton();

        System.out.println(s1 == s2);
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
Singleton Constructor called. New Object created.
Singleton Constructor called. New Object created.
false
```

**Explanation**:
- Multiple instances (`s1` and `s2`) are created because the constructor is public, and there’s no mechanism to enforce a single instance.
- The `==` check returns `false` because `s1` and `s2` are different objects.

**Use Case**: Not a Singleton; used when multiple instances are acceptable.

### 2. Simple Singleton (Lazy Initialization)
This is a basic Singleton implementation using lazy initialization, suitable for single-threaded environments.

```java
public class SimpleSingleton {
    private static SimpleSingleton instance = null;

    private SimpleSingleton() {
        System.out.println("Singleton Constructor called");
    }

    public static SimpleSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new SimpleSingleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SimpleSingleton s1 = SimpleSingleton.getInstance();
        SimpleSingleton s2 = SimpleSingleton.getInstance();

        System.out.println(s1 == s2);
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
Singleton Constructor called
true
```

**Explanation**:
- **Private Constructor**: Prevents external instantiation.
- **Static Instance**: Initialized lazily (only when `getInstance` is called).
- **Static Method**: `getInstance` checks if `instance` is null and creates it if needed.
- The `==` check returns `true` because `s1` and `s2` refer to the same instance.

**Advantages**:
- Simple and effective for single-threaded applications.
- Lazy initialization delays object creation until needed, saving resources.

**Disadvantages**:
- Not thread-safe; multiple threads calling `getInstance` simultaneously may create multiple instances.

**Use Case**: Single-threaded applications where resource efficiency is a priority.

### 3. Thread-Safe Singleton (Synchronized Method)
This variant adds thread safety by synchronizing the `getInstance` method, suitable for multi-threaded environments.

```java
public class ThreadSafeLockingSingleton {
    private static ThreadSafeLockingSingleton instance = null;

    private ThreadSafeLockingSingleton() {
        System.out.println("Singleton Constructor Called!");
    }

    public static synchronized ThreadSafeLockingSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new ThreadSafeLockingSingleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ThreadSafeLockingSingleton s1 = ThreadSafeLockingSingleton.getInstance();
        ThreadSafeLockingSingleton s2 = ThreadSafeLockingSingleton.getInstance();

        System.out.println(s1 == s2);
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
Singleton Constructor Called!
true
```

**Explanation**:
- **Synchronized Keyword**: The `getInstance` method is synchronized, ensuring only one thread can execute it at a time.
- Prevents multiple instances in a multi-threaded environment.

**Advantages**:
- Thread-safe, ensuring a single instance in multi-threaded applications.
- Simple to implement.

**Disadvantages**:
- Performance overhead due to synchronization on every `getInstance` call, even after the instance is created.

**Use Case**: Multi-threaded applications where simplicity is preferred over performance optimization.

### 4. Thread-Safe Singleton (Double-Checked Locking)
This optimizes the thread-safe Singleton by reducing synchronization overhead using double-checked locking.

```java
public class ThreadSafeDoubleLockingSingleton {
    private static volatile ThreadSafeDoubleLockingSingleton instance = null;

    private ThreadSafeDoubleLockingSingleton() {
        System.out.println("Singleton Constructor Called!");
    }

    public static ThreadSafeDoubleLockingSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) { // First check (no locking)
            synchronized (ThreadSafeDoubleLockingSingleton.class) { // Lock only if needed
                if (instance == null) { // Second check (after acquiring lock)
                    instance = new ThreadSafeDoubleLockingSingleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ThreadSafeDoubleLockingSingleton s1 = ThreadSafeDoubleLockingSingleton.getInstance();
        ThreadSafeDoubleLockingSingleton s2 = ThreadSafeDoubleLockingSingleton.getInstance();

        System.out.println(s1 == s2);
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
Singleton Constructor Called!
true
```

**Explanation**:
- **Double-Checked Locking**: Checks `instance == null` twice—once without locking to avoid synchronization overhead, and again inside a synchronized block to ensure thread safety.
- **Volatile Keyword**: Ensures visibility of the `instance` variable across threads and prevents instruction reordering.

**Advantages**:
- Thread-safe with reduced synchronization overhead (only synchronizes during instance creation).
- Lazy initialization conserves resources.

**Disadvantages**:
- More complex than synchronized method.
- Requires `volatile` in Java to ensure thread safety (pre-Java 5 had issues with double-checked locking).

**Use Case**: Multi-threaded applications where performance is critical, and lazy initialization is desired.

### 5. Thread-Safe Singleton (Eager Initialization)
This variant creates the instance eagerly at class loading time, ensuring thread safety without synchronization.

```java
public class ThreadSafeEagerSingleton {
    private static ThreadSafeEagerSingleton instance = new ThreadSafeEagerSingleton();

    private ThreadSafeEagerSingleton() {
        System.out.println("Singleton Constructor Called!");
    }

    public static ThreadSafeEagerSingleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ThreadSafeEagerSingleton s1 = ThreadSafeEagerSingleton.getInstance();
        ThreadSafeEagerSingleton s2 = ThreadSafeEagerSingleton.getInstance();

        System.out.println(s1 == s2);
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
Singleton Constructor Called!
true
```

**Explanation**:
- **Eager Initialization**: The instance is created when the class is loaded, before any `getInstance` call.
- Thread-safe because the JVM guarantees static field initialization is thread-safe.

**Advantages**:
- Simplest thread-safe implementation.
- No synchronization overhead.

**Disadvantages**:
- Eager initialization may waste resources if the instance is never used.
- No lazy loading, which can delay startup time in large applications.

**Use Case**: Multi-threaded applications where the Singleton is always needed, and startup time is not a concern.

### 6. Bill Pugh Singleton (Initialization-on-Demand Holder Idiom)
This is an alternative thread-safe implementation using a static inner class for lazy initialization, not included in the provided code but worth mentioning for completeness.

```java
public class BillPughSingleton {
    private BillPughSingleton() {
        System.out.println("Singleton Constructor Called!");
    }

    private static class SingletonHolder {
        private static final BillPughSingleton INSTANCE = new BillPughSingleton();
    }

    public static BillPughSingleton getInstance() {
        return SingletonHolder.INSTANCE;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BillPughSingleton s1 = BillPughSingleton.getInstance();
        BillPughSingleton s2 = BillPughSingleton.getInstance();

        System.out.println(s1 == s2);
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
Singleton Constructor Called!
true
```

**Explanation**:
- **Static Inner Class**: The `SingletonHolder` class is loaded only when `getInstance` is called, providing lazy initialization.
- Thread-safe because the JVM handles class initialization in a thread-safe manner.

**Advantages**:
- Thread-safe without synchronization.
- Lazy initialization without the complexity of double-checked locking.

**Disadvantages**:
- Slightly more complex than eager initialization.
- Less commonly known compared to other approaches.

**Use Case**: Multi-threaded applications where lazy initialization and simplicity are desired.

## Key Differences Between Variants
| **Variant**                  | **Initialization** | **Thread Safety** | **Performance** | **Complexity** | **Use Case** |
|------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Non-Singleton**            | N/A                | No                | High            | Low            | When multiple instances are needed |

| **Thread-Safe (Synchronized)** | Lazy             | Yes               | Low (sync overhead) | Medium         | Simple multi-threaded applications |
| **Thread-Safe (Double-Checked)** | Lazy           | Yes               | High (minimal sync) | High           | Performance-critical multi-threaded apps |
| **Thread-Safe (Eager)**      | Eager              | Yes               | High            | Low            | Always-used Singletons in multi-threaded apps |
| **Bill Pugh Singleton**      | Lazy               | Yes               | High            | Medium         | Lazy, thread-safe Singletons |

## Advantages of Singleton
- Ensures a single instance, conserving resources and maintaining global state.
- Provides a global access point, simplifying access to shared resources.
- Lazy initialization (in some variants) delays resource allocation.

## Disadvantages
- Can introduce global state, making testing and debugging harder.
- Thread safety adds complexity or performance overhead.
- Can violate the Single Responsibility Principle if the Singleton handles too many tasks.
- Difficult to subclass or mock for testing.

## When to Use
- When a single instance is required (e.g., database connection pool, logger, configuration manager).
- When global access to a resource is needed without passing references.
- When lazy initialization is beneficial, and thread safety is required (use double-checked or Bill Pugh).

## When Not to Use
- When multiple instances are needed or beneficial.
- In highly testable systems, as Singletons can complicate dependency injection.
- When the Singleton’s global state causes side effects or race conditions.

## Real-World Examples
- **Logger**: A single logging instance to write logs consistently across an application.
- **Database Connection Pool**: A single pool to manage database connections efficiently.
- **Configuration Manager**: A single instance to hold application-wide settings.

## Summary
The Singleton Design Pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access to it. The provided code illustrates various implementations:
- **Simple Singleton** for single-threaded use.
- **Thread-Safe (Synchronized)** for basic thread safety.
- **Thread-Safe (Double-Checked Locking)** for optimized thread safety.
- **Thread-Safe (Eager)** for simplicity and guaranteed thread safety.
- **Bill Pugh Singleton** (added) for lazy, thread-safe initialization without synchronization.

Choose the variant based on your application’s threading requirements, performance needs, and initialization preferences. For most modern applications, the **Bill Pugh Singleton** or **Double-Checked Locking** is recommended for thread-safe, lazy initialization.
