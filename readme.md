## System Design
System design is the process of defining the
- architecture
- components
- modules
- interfaces
- data for a system 

to *satisfy* specified requirements. In software engineering, it involves planning how different parts of a software application or system will work together, including considerations for scalability, reliability, maintainability, and performance. System design is typically divided into:

- **High-level design (HLD):** Focuses on the overall system architecture and how major components interact.
- **Low-level design (LLD):** Details the internal logic of individual components.

System design is crucial for building robust, efficient, and scalable systems.

## Low Level Design (LLD)
Low Level Design (LLD) is the process of detailing the internal logic of individual system components. It describes how each module or class will be implemented, including algorithms, data structures, and interactions between components. LLD typically includes:

- Class diagrams and method definitions  
- Database schema details  
- API specifications  
- Pseudocode or flowcharts for logic

LLD provides developers with the information needed to write actual code for each component.

**LLD mainly focuses on the following 3 things:**
- *Scalability*
- *Maintainability*
- *Reusability*
