# Inheritance and Polymorphism (3rd and 4th Pillars of OOP)

## Inheritance
- Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows a new class (child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (parent class).
- Inheritance promotes code reusability while maintaining hierarchical relationships.
- It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.
- The child class can add new properties and methods or override existing ones from the parent class.

## Polymorphism

- Polymorphism allows one interface to perform `multiple behaviors based on context`.
- It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).
- There are two types of polymorphism:
  - Compile-time polymorphism (Method Overloading): Same method name with different parameters.
  - Runtime polymorphism (Method Overriding): Same method name in parent and child classes, where the child class's method overrides the parent's method.
