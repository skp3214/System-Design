# SOLID Design Principles - Part 1

## SOLID Design Principles
The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help software developers create maintainable, scalable, and robust object-oriented systems. The acronym SOLID stands for:
- [**S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](#single-responsibility-principle-srp)
- [**O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](#openclosed-principle-ocp)
- [**L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](#liskov-substitution-principle-lsp)
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and are widely adopted in software engineering.

## [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)]()
The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. This principle helps in reducing the complexity of the code and makes it easier to maintain.
### Example of Voilated SRP
```java
class User {
    private String name;
    private String email;

    public User(String name, String email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }

    public void save() {
        // Code to save user to database
    }

    public void sendEmail() {
        // Code to send email to user
    }
}
```
In the above example, the `User` class has two responsibilities: saving the user to the database and sending an email. This violates the SRP. To adhere to SRP, we can refactor the code as follows:

### Example of Refactored SRP
```java
class User {
    private String name;
    private String email;

    public User(String name, String email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }

    // Getters and setters
}
class UserRepository {
    public void save(User user) {
        // Code to save user to database
    }
}
class EmailService {
    public void sendEmail(User user) {
        // Code to send email to user
    }
}
```
In this refactored code, the `User` class has only one responsibility (holding user data), while the `UserRepository` and `EmailService` classes handle saving the user and sending emails, respectively.

## [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)]()
The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.
### Example of Voilated OCP
```java
class Shape {
    public double area() {
        return 0;
    }
}
class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return width * height;
    }
}
```
In the above example, the `Shape` class is open for extension because we can create new shapes (like `Circle` and `Rectangle`) without modifying the `Shape` class itself. The `area()` method is overridden in each subclass to provide specific implementations.
### Refactoring for OCP
To adhere to the Open/Closed Principle, we can use interfaces or abstract classes to define a common contract for shapes. This allows us to add new shapes without modifying existing code.
```java
interface Shape {
    double area();
}
class Circle implements Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return width * height;
    }
}
```
In this refactored code, the `Shape` interface defines a contract for all shapes, and each shape class implements the `area()` method. This allows us to add new shapes without modifying existing classes, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

## [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)]()
The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a parent class should be replaceable with objects of a child class without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, if `S` is a subtype of `T`, then objects of type `T` should be replaceable with objects of type `S` without altering the desirable properties of the program.
### Example of LSP
```java
class Bird {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Flying");
    }
}
class Sparrow extends Bird {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Sparrow flying");
    }
}
class Penguin extends Bird {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Penguins can't fly");
    }
}
```
In the above example, the `Penguin` class violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it cannot be substituted for the `Bird` class without causing an exception. This is because penguins cannot fly, which is a behavior expected from all birds.
### Refactoring for LSP
To adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle, we can create a separate interface for flying birds and have only those birds implement it.
```java
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}
class Bird {
    // Common bird properties and methods
}
class Sparrow extends Bird implements Flyable {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Sparrow flying");
    }
}
class Penguin extends Bird {
    // Penguins do not implement Flyable
}
```
In this refactored code, the `Flyable` interface defines the `fly()` method, and only birds that can fly (like `Sparrow`) implement it. This allows us to substitute `Sparrow` for `Bird` without violating the Liskov Substitution Principle.

### General Guidelines for LSP
- [**Signature Rule**]() : The signature of the overridden method in the subclass should match the signature of the method in the parent class.
  - *`Method Argument Rule`*: The method in the subclass should accept the same type of arguments as the method in the parent class.
    
    [Code Example](/system-design/5/MethodArgumentRule.cpp)
  - *`Return Type Rule`*: The return type of the method in the subclass should be the same or a subtype of the return type in the parent class.

    [Code Example](/system-design/5/ReturnTypeRule.cpp)
  - *`Exception Rule`*: The method in the subclass should not throw exceptions that are not thrown by the method in the parent class.

    [Code Example](/system-design/5/ExceptionRule.cpp)

- [**Property Rule**]() : The properties of the subclass should be compatible with the properties of the parent class.

  - *`Class Invariant`* : The class invariant should be maintained in the subclass. This means that the properties of the parent class should still hold true in the subclass.

    [Code Example](/system-design/5/ClassInvariant.cpp)

  - *`History Constraint`* : The history constraint states that the subclass should not violate the history of the parent class. This means that the subclass should not change the state of the parent class in a way that violates its history.

    [Code Example](/system-design/5/HistoryConstraint.cpp)

- [**Method Rule**]() : The methods in the subclass should not violate the behavior of the parent class.

  - *`Pre-Condition Rule`* : The pre-conditions of the method in the subclass should be the same or weaker than the pre-conditions of the method in the parent class. This means that the subclass should not require more conditions to be met than the parent class.

    [Code Example](/system-design/5/PreConditionRule.cpp)

  - *`Post-Condition Rule`* : The post-conditions of the method in the subclass should be the same or stronger than the post-conditions of the method in the parent class. This means that the subclass should guarantee at least the same results as the parent class.

    [Code Example](/system-design/5/PostConditionRule.cpp)
