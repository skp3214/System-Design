# SOLID Design Principles - Part 2

## SOLID Design Principles
The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help software developers create maintainable, scalable, and robust object-oriented systems. The acronym SOLID stands for:
- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- [**I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](#interface-segregation-principle-isp)
- [**D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](#dependency-inversion-principle-dip)

These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and are widely adopted in software engineering.

## [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)]()
The Interface Segregation Principle states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. This principle encourages the creation of smaller, more specific interfaces rather than a large, general-purpose interface. It helps in reducing the impact of changes and promotes better code organization.
### Example of Violated ISP
```java
interface Animal {
    void eat();
    void fly();
    void swim();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        // Dog eats
    }

    @Override
    public void fly() {
        // Not applicable for Dog
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Dog cannot fly");
    }

    @Override
    public void swim() {
        // Dog swims
    }
}
```
In the above example, the `Animal` interface has methods that are not applicable to all animals. The `Dog` class is forced to implement the `fly` method, which leads to an exception being thrown. This violates the ISP.
### Example of Refactored ISP
```java
interface Eater {
    void eat();
}
interface Flyer {
    void fly();
}
interface Swimmer {
    void swim();
}
class Dog implements Eater, Swimmer {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        // Dog eats
    }

    @Override
    public void swim() {
        // Dog swims
    }
}
class Bird implements Eater, Flyer {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        // Bird eats
    }

    @Override
    public void fly() {
        // Bird flies
    }
}
```
In this refactored code, we have created smaller interfaces (`Eater`, `Flyer`, and `Swimmer`) that allow classes to implement only the methods they need. This adheres to the Interface Segregation Principle and avoids unnecessary dependencies.

## [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)]()
The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. This principle promotes loose coupling and enhances the flexibility of the code.
### Example of Violated DIP
```java
class LightBulb {
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("LightBulb is ON");
    }
}
class Switch {
    private LightBulb lightBulb;

    public Switch(LightBulb lightBulb) {
        this.lightBulb = lightBulb;
    }

    public void operate() {
        lightBulb.turnOn();
    }
}
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LightBulb lightBulb = new LightBulb();
        Switch lightSwitch = new Switch(lightBulb);
        lightSwitch.operate(); // Output: LightBulb is ON
    }
}
```
In the above example, the `Switch` class directly depends on the `LightBulb` class, which creates a tight coupling between them. If we want to change the light source (e.g., to a `LED`), we would have to modify the `Switch` class.

### Example of Refactored DIP
```java
interface LightSource {
    void turnOn();
}
class LightBulb implements LightSource {
    @Override
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("LightBulb is ON");
    }
}
class LED implements LightSource {
    @Override
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("LED is ON");
    }
}
class Switch {
    private LightSource lightSource;

    public Switch(LightSource lightSource) {
        this.lightSource = lightSource;
    }

    public void operate() {
        lightSource.turnOn();
    }
}
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LightSource lightBulb = new LightBulb();
        Switch lightSwitch = new Switch(lightBulb);
        lightSwitch.operate(); // Output: LightBulb is ON

        LightSource led = new LED();
        Switch ledSwitch = new Switch(led);
        ledSwitch.operate(); // Output: LED is ON
    }
}
```
In this refactored code, we have introduced the `LightSource` interface, which both `LightBulb` and `LED` implement. The `Switch` class now depends on the abstraction (`LightSource`) rather than a concrete implementation. This allows us to easily switch between different light sources without modifying the `Switch` class, adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle.
