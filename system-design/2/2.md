# Object Oriented Programming - OOPS

## History Of Programming

- **Machine Language**
  - Uses binary code (0s and 1s) to communicate with the computer's hardware.

- **Assembly Language**
    - A low-level programming language that uses symbolic instructions and mnemonics to represent machine code.
    - Easier to read and write than machine language, but still closely tied to the hardware.

- **Procedural Language**
    - A high-level programming language that uses procedures or routines to perform tasks.
    - `Examples`: C, Pascal, Fortran.

- **Object-Oriented Language**
    - A programming paradigm that uses objects to represent data and methods to manipulate that data.
    - `Examples`: C++, Java, Python, Ruby.


## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of organizing and structuring code using **classes** and **objects**.

- **Class:** A class is like a blueprint that defines the `characteristics` (attributes) and `behaviour` (methods) that objects created from it will have. For `example`, a `Car` class might define that every car has a color and can drive.

- **Object:** An object is a specific instance created from a class. If `Car` is the class, then a red car or a blue car are objects. Each object has its own values for the `characteristics` defined in the class.

OOP helps in organizing code, making it reusable and easier to manage by grouping related data and functions together.

## Pillars of OOP
OOP is based on four main principles:
1. **Abstraction**:
    - When you show only the essential features of an object and hide the complex implementation details behind it.
    - `Example`: A car has a steering wheel, pedals, and a gear shift. You don't need to know how the engine works to drive it.
    - In programming, abstraction allows you to use complex systems without needing to understand all the details.
    
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    class Car {
    public:
        virtual void startEngine() = 0; // pure virtual function
        virtual void stopEngine() = 0;  // pure virtual function
        virtual void drive() = 0;       // pure virtual function
        virtual ~Car() {}               // virtual destructor
    };

    class Tesla : public Car {
    public:
        string name;   // characteristics
        string model;
        bool isElectric;
        int currentSpeed;
        int maxSpeed;

        Tesla(string a, string b, bool c, int d, int e)
            : name(a), model(b), isElectric(c),
              currentSpeed(d), maxSpeed(e) {}

        void startEngine() override {               // behaviours
            cout << "Tesla engine started" << endl;
        }
        void stopEngine() override {
            cout << "Tesla engine stopped" << endl;
        }
        void drive() override {
            cout << "Tesla is driving" << endl;
        }
    };

    int main() {
        Car* car = new Tesla("Tesla", "Model S", true, 0, 200);
        car->startEngine(); // Abstraction 
        car->drive();
        car->stopEngine();
        delete car; // free memory

        return 0;
    }
    ```
2. **Encapsulation**:
    - The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class.
    - It restricts direct access to some of the object's components and can prevent the accidental modification of data.
    - `Example`: A class that represents a bank account might have private attributes for the account balance and public methods to deposit and withdraw money.
    
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    class BankAccount {
    private:
        double balance; // private attribute
    public:
        BankAccount() : balance(0.0) {} // constructor

        void deposit(double amount) { // public method
            if (amount > 0) {
                balance += amount;
            }
        }

        void withdraw(double amount) { // public method
            if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
                balance -= amount;
            }
        }

        double getBalance() { // public method
            return balance;
        }
    };
    int main() {
        BankAccount account;
        account.deposit(1000);
        account.withdraw(500);
        cout << "Current balance: " << account.getBalance() << endl; // Encapsulation
        return 0;
    }
    ```
