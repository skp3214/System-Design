# System Design

## Overview of System Design

System Design is a critical discipline in software engineering that focuses on architecting robust, scalable, and efficient systems to meet real-world requirements. It bridges the gap between high-level concepts and low-level implementations, ensuring that software solutions are both functional and maintainable. This course is divided into **Low-Level Design (LLD)** and **High-Level Design (HLD)** to provide a comprehensive understanding of the process.

### Key Objectives
- **LLD**: Focuses on the detailed design of individual components, including object-oriented principles, design patterns, and project implementations.
- **HLD**: Emphasizes the overall system architecture, including scalability, load balancing, data distribution, and integration strategies (to be added later).
- **Holistic Approach**: Combines theoretical foundations with practical projects to prepare learners for end-to-end system development.
